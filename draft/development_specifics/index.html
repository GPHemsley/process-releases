        <h1>Mozilla Firefox: Development Specifics</h1>
        <p><font color="red"><b>Status: Draft</b></font></p>
        
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This document discusses specifics related to Mozilla's newly proposed 
        <a href="../development_overview/">Firefox development model</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Please note this is a draft document and subject to change.</p>
        <p>Discussion should take place on <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.planning">dev-planning</a> and changes
        should be submitted as 
        <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/process-releases">pull requests on GitHub</a>.</p>


        <h2>Main Repositories</h2>
           
            <p><img src="img/repos.png"></p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-central</h3>
                    <p>Just like the current repository</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-experimental</h3>
                    <p>Stabilize work done on mozilla-central for release</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-beta</h3>
                    <p>Fix any issues that come up during the beta 
                      validation of the mozilla-experimental stabilization</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>mozilla-release</h3>
                    <p>Repository for code to generate officially released
                    Firefox binaries</p>
                    <p class="question">Why not copy to releases/mozilla-X.Y?
                    We currently do so to have a repo to use for
                    .x releases. Because this new model doesn't have .x 
                    releases (only chemspill/rapid response updates) we don't
                    need to copy to the releases directory and deal with the
                    version naming. That being said, we could still do
                    so if we wanted to but there doesn't appear to be
                    much benefit/point. <strong>Please give feedback</strong>.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            The main goal of this repository naming scheme is consistency.
            The repos have their default channel as part of their name.
            This should make it so there is no confusion which channel a build
            from a particular repo is pushed to.
            Additionally, automated tools can key off the
            names and infer channels without a lookup table.</p>
            <p> The general naming scheme should work
            equally well for other products if they decide to follow the same
            development/channel/repo model. Also note if in the future
            Firefox releases
            split from platform releases the naming scheme does
            not need to change...we would merely create firefox-* repositories.
            </p>
            <p>
            mozilla-central was chosen as the main development repository name
            due to familiarity, to prevent developers from 
            having to alter their local repos, and to prevent 
            needless changes to tools.
           </p>
           <p class="discussion">
            Please note product marketing isn't happy with the channel names,
            which may or may not affect repo names. The UX team is also looking
            into other, potentially better names.</p>

           <h3>Development vs Release</h3>
           <p>The repositories can generally be grouped into two overall 
              processes: 
              development and release.
              Project repositories and mozilla-central are part of the 
              <em>development</em> process. 
              The downstream repositories are part of the
              <em>release</em> process.</p>
           <p>This document mainly covers the release process. Details about
              project pages, feature tracking, and bug management are out of
              scope for this proposal and will be discussed soon.
           </p>

        <h2>Update Channels</h2>
        <p>As stated above, the update channel is embedded in each repository
           name. Thus, for each of the above repositories in the form
           [product]-[channel] we have the following channels:</p>

        <p><img src="img/channels.png"></p>
        <ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>central</h3>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <th>Current Users</th>
                        <td>50,000</td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <th>Type of User</th>

                <p class="question"> Why not "nightly" for the channel name (as it is now)? Because there will be be nightly updates on the other channels and the nomenclature would get confusing quickly. Why not mozilla-central or trunk? Those refer to repos, not channels.</p>

                <p>
                This is a new channel. We will discuss populating this channel artificially if need be. The hope is people will self-select into this channel due to the balance of new features and stability.</p>

        <h2>Versioning</h2>

        
        <p>Because updates are (intended) to be silent and automatic 
        we can generally assume a user on a given channel is on the 
        latest available build. This assumption simplifies things greatly.
        </p>

        <h3>Firefox Versioning</h3>
        <p class="discussion">
        There are currently two version proposals for Firefox. 
        <strong>Please give feedback or an alternate approach</strong>.</p>

        <h4>Standard</h4>
        <p><img src="img/old_versions.png"></p>
        <p>During Firefox 5 development builds on mozilla-central identify as 
           5.0pre. When the time comes for the mozilla-central &rarr;
           mozilla-experimental merge mozilla-central becomes 6.0pre and
           mozilla-experimental keeps 5.0pre. When the time comes for the
           mozilla-experimental &rarr; mozilla-beta merge mozilla-central
           becomes 7.0pre, mozilla-experimental becomes 6.0pre, and
           mozilla-beta becomes 5.0.
        </p>

        <h4>Chrome-style</h4>
        <p><img src="img/chrome_versions.png"></p>
        <p>The version number is in the form "[major firefox version].[mozilla-beta build #].[mozilla-experimental build #].[mozilla-central build #]"
        </p>
        <p>
        During Firefox 5 development mozilla-central would start out at
        5.0.0.0. For every nightly build we increment the mozilla-central
        position by one. When the time comes for the mozilla-central &rarr;
        mozilla-experimental merge mozilla-central becomes 6.0.0.0 while
        mozilla-experimental takes the previous mozilla-central number. For
        every build on mozilla-experimental we increment the
        mozilla-experimental slot. The process continues until a build is on 
        mozilla-release with a frozen version number.
        </p>

        <p>For this versioning scheme to be successful we need a way to
        query the latest build from a given repo and Release Engineering needs
        a way to increment build numbers sanely.
        </p>
        <h3>Gecko versioning</h3>
        <p>
            Gecko versioning will tie into Firefox versioning
            regardless of the Firefox version scheme above.
            For Firefox 5, the gecko version will be 5.0, for 
            Firefox 6, 6.0, etc.
        </p>
        <p class="note">Please note that binary extensions will 
        <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/200a746e0fac">already need to
        be recompiled for Firefox 5</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Project Repositories</h2>
        <p>Project repositories are cheap and developers should not hesitate
        to <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering:ProjectBranchPlanning">ask for one.</a>

        <p>Project repositories should be grouped by team or area in 
           subdirectories under 
           <em>hg.mozilla.org/projects</em>.
            In this scheme Tracemonkey can be found
           at <em>hg.mozilla.org/projects/js/tracemonkey</em>.
            Additional repos
           for the js team would be created in 
           <em>hg.mozilla.org/projects/js</em>
           as well. This should keep hg.mozilla.org organized and enable
           automated tools to enumerate the available project repositories
           easily.
        </p>

        <p>Please note the above naming convention is different from what
        was used in the past. Existing project repositories may need
        to be moved around to fit in with the new scheme.</p>

        <p>Project repositories automatically get an update channel when 
           nightly builds are enabled. The
           naming convention for the channel is the path from root repo,
           with slashes converted to dashes.
           For the Tracemonkey example above, builds would be generated and
           posted to <em>projects-js-tracemonkey</em>.
        </p>

            <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/DisposableProjectBranches">disposable project
           repositories</a>.</p>

        <p class="discussion">These naming conventions for project repositories
        have not been widely discussed yet.

        <h2>The Shadow Repository</h3>
        Having a restricted shadow repository is new to Mozilla.
        We are trying to balance the fact we are open source with
        the need to secure our users by not publishing information about
        security vulnerabilities before our users are protected.</p>
        <p><strong>Most developers and users need not worry or care about
        mozilla-shadow, so feel free to ignore it (most of the graphics omit
        it for clarity).
        </strong>
        </p>
        <h3>mozilla-shadow</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shadows mozilla-central and takes additional security fixes</li>
            <li>Merges into mozilla-experimental at the mozilla-central &rarr;
            mozilla-experimental merge point</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Localization</h2>
        <p>Localization work will be split into similar repositories:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>l10n-central</li>
            <li>l10n-experimental</li>
            <li>l10n-beta</li>
            <li>l10n-release</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="discussion">
        Please be aware there is discussion about the l10n
        repo names and their content.
        Axel expressed the desire to have the current l10n-central repo
        track mozilla-experimental and to create a new repo to track
        mozilla-central. Christian feels the naming and content should
        be consistent as it is easy to get confused about what content is where
        and which mozilla-* repository l10n-* is shadowing.
        Axel is the ultimate 
        decision-maker with respect to l10n repositories.</p>

        <p>There will be 8 or so locales that track mozilla-central,
        localizing alongside en-US development. Other locales can track
        mozilla-central if they would like to as well but they won't be
        asked to explicitly.</p>
        <p>mozilla-central will be string frozen for en-US at the 
        mozilla-central &rarr; mozilla-experimental merge point. <strong>No 
        en-US strings will be allowed on mozilla-experimental</strong>. The
        mozilla-central &rarr; mozilla-experimental merge date will happen on
        schedule so the string freeze should not come as a surprise.
        </p>
        <p>For locales that don't track mozilla-central, their work is done in
        l10n-experimental, which tracks mozilla-experimental. <strong>This means
        most locales have 6 weeks to complete their localizations</strong>.
        </p>


        <h2>Schedule of Important Milestones</h2>

        <p>In general, each stage of the process (and activity pertaining to
        a particular version) lasts for 6 weeks.<p>
        <p><img src="img/6_weeks.png"></p>

        <h3>Firefox 5</h3>
        <p>Firefox 5 will be slightly different from future releases due to
        the development overlap (or lack thereof) with Firefox 4:</p>

        <p><img src="img/ff5_schedule.png"></p>

        <p>Rather than 6 weeks for mozilla-central, mozilla-experimental, and
        mozilla-beta we instead have 3 weeks for development on 
        mozilla-central, 5 weeks to converge and stabilize on 
        mozilla-experimental, and 5 weeks to validate on mozilla-beta.</p>

        <h3>Firefox 6</h3>
        <p>Firefox 6 will start the normal schedule where every step in the
        cycle takes 6 weeks. Firefox 6's development cycle starts when 
        Firefox 5 is cloned from mozilla-central to mozilla-experimental
        (on 2011-04-12).</p>
        <p>Please note there will be a week-long period where updates are not
            generated on both the experimental and beta channels (out of the
            mozilla-experimental and mozilla-beta repos). This is due to 
            the condensed Firefox 5 schedule:
        </p>
        <p><img src="img/gap.png"></p>

        <p>Again, because the schedule is fixed one can
        <a href="http://hg.mozilla.org/users/clegnitto_mozilla.com/release_tools/file/default/release_schedule.py">write a simple program</a> to print out important release
        milestones:
        </p>
        <pre>
        Development on mozilla-central for Firefox 6 on 2011-04-12
            Development on mozilla-central for Firefox 6 ends on 2011-05-24
        Pull from mozilla-central to mozilla-experimental for Firefox 6 on 2011-05-24
            Development on mozilla-experimental for Firefox 6 ends on 2011-07-05
        Pull from mozilla-experimental to mozilla-beta for Firefox 6 on 2011-07-05
            Development on mozilla-beta for Firefox 6 ends on 2011-08-16
        Pull from mozilla-beta to mozilla-release for Firefox 6 on 2011-08-16
        </pre>

        <p>Please do note that chemspills / rapid response updates are not 
        reflected in these schedules and will be dealt with on an as-needed
         basis.</p>

        <h2>Cloning Mechanics</h2>
        <p>The inital thought was to blow away what is in the downstream repo
        with upstream repo content at the clone point, but there were concerns
        with losing history and the impact on l10n.</p>
        <p>Developers and RelEng have also expressed concerns with relanding
        backouts and pref-offs every time we merge repos.</p>
        <p>Eventually the cloning / merging should be automated but for Firefox
        5 it will likely be manual. Chiristian is tasked with organizing or
        actually doing the merges during Firefox 5 development.
        </p>
        <p>
            More discussion is needed for the merging mechanics.
        </p>

        <h2>Rapid Release / Chemspill Updates</h2>
        <p>We are still in the information gathering phase and will
        have this section filled out in the next couple of days.</p>

        <h2>General Observations</h2>
         <h3>Deferring work</h3>
         <p><strong>No work is deferred from upstream repos to downstream
            repos</strong>. If your feature / change isn't finished on
            mozilla-central, mozilla-experimental is <strong>not</strong>
            the place to fix it up. If there is outstanding work on
            mozilla-experimental <strong>do not plan</strong> to fix it in
            mozilla-beta. The clone / pull dates are published far in 
            advance so there should be ample time to plan. 
            <strong>
              If it's not ready it should be backed out or preffed off.
            </strong>
            There will be another release in 6-12 weeks for the fix to try 
            to make it in again.</p>
         <h3>Time-based cloning</h3>
         <p>
            Cloning between repos <strong>will</strong> happen on schedule.
            Again, consistency is key. Groups will be able to plan and won't
            need to be intimately involved with the release process 
            to know where fixes are and where fixes should be landed. 
         </p>

         <h3>The merge between release repos should be automatic</h3>
         <p>
            When the time comes to merge upstream release repositories with
            downstream repositories we are essentially replacing the downstream
            repository with a copy of the upstream. Because the
            merge/clone should never fail and it happens on a set schedule it
            will likely be automated.
        </p>
        <p>Please note in the section above there is still discussion on
        what can be automated and the proper version control mechanics.
        </p>
        <h3>Preffing off / backing out happens after the clone</h3>
        <p>
           When cloning from mozilla-central to mozilla-experimental
           the backouts and pref offs take place on the mozilla-experimental
           repo. This allows mozilla-central to use the complete allotted time
           for development and utilizes mozilla-experimental's time for 
           convergence.
